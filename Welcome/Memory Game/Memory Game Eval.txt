Memory Game Eval:

Game was fine, some cards were harder to see than others, game worked as intended, no issues or bugs regarding the game. 
I think there can be more visuals but Alex spoke about a lot of issues regarding sprite imports. 
Told me about how cards were just disappearing when clicked for a while and some imports just had to be deleted and re-imported.
Love me a good memory game though, fun to play, turns were counted along with matches. 10/10 would add micro transactions.
